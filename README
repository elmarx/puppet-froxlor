froxlor
-------

This module install froxlor, a configuration panel for typical PHP-hosting services.

It installs and configures:

- froxlor
- postfix
- dovecot
- proftpd
- apache2 with modphp
- phpmyadmin
- roundcube (webmailer)

It's only tested for debian wheezy, and very opinionated (thus: not very configurable), since froxlor itself is very
opinionated and this is my very first complete puppet module, and it only covers my usecase.

But I'm open for improvement suggestions/pull requests.
